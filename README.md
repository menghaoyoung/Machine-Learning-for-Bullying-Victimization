# Machine-Learning-for-Bullying-Victimization
This code uses the LightGBM algorithms to analyze the detecting risk of bullying victimization among adolescents. It presents the feature importance within the LightGBM algorithms to predict bullying victimization by using SHAP values and reveals the direction of effects at different levels of each factor. The dot color is redder when the feature value becomes higher, and the dot color is bluer when the feature value becomes lower.
